Description of 'Obrazek1'.

A short description of three women, which are walking down the street.
In program 'Obraze1.pl' I named all the women by the colour of their dresses.

Datils listed to check: if dresses are short or long, their hair colours, and if they're smailing.

There are three functions, where we can compare details:
dressLength - if dress length is the same for two of them.
sameHair - if they all have the same hair colour.
sameSmile - check, if two of them smiling at the picture.

Examples of question to use:
dressLength(yellow, black).
woman(X). - and by pressing ";" we can list all women in the program.
sameHair(yellow, white, black). 
sameSmile(yellow, black).
