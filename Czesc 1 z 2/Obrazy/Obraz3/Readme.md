Description of 'Obrazek3'.

A short description of all items I could see in the picture.
In program 'Obraze3.pl' I have included 'plane' which is main item in the picture and 5 cables.

In this exercise there is only one function but I decided to show more examples of questions. One question is to check if the colour is the same for between two items.

Examples of question to use:
sameColour(cable1, cable5).
sameColour(cable2, plane).

New questions, where we can find missing object, named X:
hasWindows(X, no), isEfficient(X, yes). - It will return all cables as 'X', we just need to hit ";" as long as we get back to basic command line.
isDesignedToFly(X, yes), colour(X, white). - another example of missing 'X'.
