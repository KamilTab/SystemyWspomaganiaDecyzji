Description of 'Obrazek2'.

A short description of three heroes, which are walking in some garage.
In program 'Obraze2.pl' I named all the heroes by colours: 
- Left man as "black", due to his outfit.
- Man in the middle as "blue", due to his outfit.
- Woman on the right as "red", due to her hair colour.


In this program I simply described what I see and added one query, to check, if 'black' hero is jelaous for his 'blue' friend, that he's standing next to 'red' woman.

In this exercise there are two functions. One is to check if sex of heroes is the same, second is to check, which heroe is jelaous for others.


Examples of question to use:
isJelaous(black, blue).
sameSex(black, blue).
